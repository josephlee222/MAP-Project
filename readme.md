## Description

**App name**: Health App  
**Year**: 2021

This app is a rather simple iOS app created in XCode to calculate and store multiple user health data like:
- Weight
- Height
- Age
- Gender
- Activity Level (For calorie calculation)

The app is able to use that information to calculate:
- BMI
- Daily Calorie Intake

This app makes use of simple inbuilt features such as navigation and tab view controllers. It makes use of UserDefaults to store user information for future use. It also uses unit tests to check whether the BMI and calorie calculation is correct.
